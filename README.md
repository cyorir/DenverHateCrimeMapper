# DenverHateCrimeMapper
An app that maps different types of hate crimes that have occurred in Denver

Data is from the Denver Open Data Catalog:

https://www.denvergov.org/opendata/dataset/hate-crimes

This is a Shiny app, written in R. Necessary libraries to run this app include shiny, leaflet, rgdal, and dplyr.

Sample images are provided to demonstrate how the app works. Crime locations can be mapped by both bias type and offense type. By default, all types are mapped. Selecting a type or group of types limits results to that type or group.
